NetExt Plugin Extensions by Rodney Viana (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rodneyviana)

## Overview
This is a clone of the codeplex project [netext](https://netext.codeplex.com/) by Rodney Viana. NetExt is an internal tool that Rodney released under a limited capacity. I am hosting it on GitHub since it's not an official branch or PR. Big thanks to Rodney for giving me some guidance on extending this tool.

## Required Items

1. Visual Studio 2013 (any edition)
2. .NET 4.5
3. Windows SDK (mostly included)

## To Build
Only a few specific steps are required to build this project.

1. Clone this repository to `C:\projects\netext`. 
2. Create `C:\debuggers`
3. Create `C:\debuggers32`
